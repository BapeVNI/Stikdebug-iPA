> [!CAUTION]
> **WARNING:** There are known critical issues with **iOS 26.4 Developer Beta 1**. The `lockdownd` service appears to be dropping connections, which interferes with how the device connects to itself (loopback/pairing issues) and prevents JIT from functioning. **DO NOT UPDATE** if you rely on StikDebug. These issues and possible fixes are currently being investigated.

## How to Enable JIT

StikDebug enables **JIT** for sideloaded apps on iOS 17.4+ without needing a computer after the initial pairing setup.

### Requirements
- StikDebug installed (via AltSource, direct .ipa, or self-built)
- A valid **pairing file** (.plist / .mobiledevicepairing) for your device
- SideStore / AltStore / similar sideload tool (for app refreshing)
- A loopback vpn such as [LocalDevVPN](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localdevvpn/id6755608044)

### Steps
1. **Obtain a pairing file**  
   - Detailed guide: [Pairing File Instructions](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug-Guide/blob/main/pairing_file.md) (or ask in Discord).

2. **Set up VPN**  
   - Launch LocalDevVPN and enable the vpn.

4. **Enable JIT for an app**  
   - Launch StikDebug and press the `Enable JIT` button.
   - Select your sideloaded app from the list in StikDebug.  

**Troubleshooting**  
- "Connection dropped" or loopback errors → Check iOS version compatibility / beta warnings.  
- Heartbeat erros → Ensure that the vpn is on and that you are connecected to Wi-Fi.
- Pairing file issues → Regenerate file with device unlocked & trusted.

## Building from Source
> [!NOTE]
> StikDebug is an open-source Xcode project written mostly in Swift. Building yourself lets you modify code, debug, or create custom versions. Requires a Mac with Xcode.

### Requirements
- macOS (latest recommended)
- Xcode 16+ (Xcode 26+ preferred for iOS 26+ support)
- iOS device on iOS 17.4+ (for testing)
- Git
- Basic Xcode/Swift knowledge

### Steps
1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug.git
   cd StikDebug
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
   - Launch Xcode
   - Open `StikDebug.xcodeproj`

3. **Configure signing**
   - Select the **StikDebug** target
   - Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
   - Sign in with your Apple ID (free or paid developer account)
   - Set a unique **Bundle Identifier** (e.g., `com.yourname.StikDebug`)

4. **Build & install**
   - Select your connected device
   - Press **Cmd + R** (or Product → Run)
   - Trust the certificate on device: Settings → General → VPN & Device Management

After install, follow the JIT setup steps above (pairing import, etc.).
